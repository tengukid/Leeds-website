        Elland Road is a football stadium in Beeston, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, which has been the home of
        Championship club Leeds United since the club's formation in 1919. The stadium is the 13th largest football
        stadium in England.
        The ground has hosted FA Cup semi-final matches as a neutral venue, and England international fixtures, and was
        selected as one of eight Euro 96 venues.] Elland Road was used by rugby league club Hunslet in the mid-1980s and
        hosted two matches of the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
        Elland Road has four stands the Don Revie (North) Stand (also known as the kop), the Jack Charlton (East)
        Stand (which was once known as the Lowfields Road stand),] the Norman Hunter South Stand and the John Charles
        (West) Stand and an all-seated capacity of 37,792 Elland Road had recorded its record league attendance on 27
        December 1932, where a capacity of 56,796 watched Leeds played Arsenal and then the record attendance of 57,892
        was set on 15 March 1967 in an FA Cup fifth round replay against Sunderland. This was before the stadium became
        an all-seater venue as stipulated by the Taylor Report and the modern record is 40,287 for a Premiership match
        against Newcastle United on 22 December 2001. Plans are currently afoot to increase the capacity of Elland Road
        to 55,000, to be achieved by demolishing the West Stand and rebuilding the area.
